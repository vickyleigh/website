      <description>A doctor was about to have hs 40 year class reunion and asked if we could predict how many people would have survived to make it there.
I thought this would be a great opportunity to try making my first Shiny app.
The population and death data was from the ONS (2017) which only had data for up to 2016, so beyond this the data was forcasted.
The Shiny app is here and the code is here</description>
