A doctor was about to have hs 40 year class reunion and asked if we could predict how many people would have survived to make it there.

I thought this would be a great opportunity to try making my first Shiny app. 

The population and death data was from the [ONS (2017)](https://tinyurl.com/y7v5nvvf) which only had data for up to 2016, so beyond this the data was forcasted.

The Shiny app is [here](https://vickyleigh.shinyapps.io/ClassSurvival/)
and the code is [here](https://github.com/vickyleigh/class-survival)
