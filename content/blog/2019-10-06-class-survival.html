<p>A doctor was about to have hs 40 year class reunion and asked if we could predict how many people would have survived to make it there.</p>
<p>I thought this would be a great opportunity to try making my first Shiny app.</p>
<p>The population and death data was from the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y7v5nvvf">ONS (2017)</a> which only had data for up to 2016, so beyond this the data was forcasted.</p>
<p>The Shiny app is <a href="https://vickyleigh.shinyapps.io/ClassSurvival/">here</a> and the code is <a href="https://github.com/vickyleigh/class-survival">here</a></p>
