I am a data analyst at Norfolk County Council's Inteligence & Analytics department working mostly with data on Children's Services and Public Health. 

I have a masters degree in Research Methods of Psychology from the University of Glasgow's [Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/). My masters project investigated the effect of parental imprinting on partner preference for bisexual women with [Lisa Debruine](http://facelab.org/People/debruine).

Outside of work, I train with [Norfork Roller Derby](https://norfolkrollerderby.wixsite.com/home)

This blog is for documenting pieces of work I am partiularly proud and is very much a work in progress.
